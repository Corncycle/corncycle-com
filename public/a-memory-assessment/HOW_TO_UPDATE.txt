this is just a note for me, corncycle

to update the build of matcher:
1) delete all files in `a-memory-assessment` aside from `index.html`, `style.css`, and `HOW_TO_UPDATE.txt`
2) copy all files from `dist`, aside from `index.html`, in a `matcher` repo into `a-memory-assessment` after running `npm run build`
3) git add . git commit and git push to `corncycle-com` and github actions should automatically deploy the changes
